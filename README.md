# Distance Shocker
Code behind my embedded systems project using an ultrasonic distance sensor embedded in 3D Printed Glasses that shocks the user if they get to close to a screen, book, or notebook.
Any STL files for the glasses can be found in the 3D Files directory. All parts were commercially available parts, and code was coded using basic C# and C++ using the Arduino interface. 
The entire mission behind this project was my tendency to write too close to the paper, thus these glasses ought to serve as a method of avoidance learning, where the end user will avoid leaning in too close to avoid the electric shock.
